node-flatdb
===========
FlatDB it's a database based on JSON files, it's intended to help save 
and load informations from systems and processes that don't require 
hight data volume or read/write extreme performance.

#### Example
You have a server that need to load the configurations but need to change 
it programatically some times, you won't install a whole database engine 
for such a simple thing...

#### Installation
To install FlatDB you just need to use npm `npm install flatdb`

#### Usage

Require the db an initialize it:

    var flatdb = require('flatdb');
    var db = new flatdb('./database'); //use any existing folder as db

    //db will emit the event 'connect' when everything is ready to go
    db.on('connect', function(){

        doc = {
            "hostname" : "localhost",
            "port" : 8001,
            "user" : "myuser",
            "date" : new Date().getTime()
        }

        //insert some information in the database
        db.save(doc, function(err){
            if(err) throw err;
            console.log('Finished insering information.');

            //find some information on the database
            db.find({"user" : "myuser"}, function(err, docs){
                if(err) throw err;
                console.log("We found: ", docs);

                //now let's update every document that have the hostname
                //"localhost" to use the port 1337
                db.update({"hostname" : "localhost"}, {"port" : 1337}, function(err){
                    console.log('Finished updating...');

                    //let's delete every document that have the key "user"
                    //with the valye "myuser"
                    db.delete({"user" : "myuser"}, function(err){
                        if(err) throw err;
                        console.log('Finished deleting...');
                    });
                });
            });
        });
    });

For handling startup error, FlatDB emits a `error` event, so you can catch it like:

    var flatdb = require('flatdb');
    var db = new flatdb('./nonexistent/path'); //force error

    //db will emit the event 'connect' when everything is ready to go
    db.on('connect', function(){
        console.log('This message should not appear...')
    });

    //catch startup error here
    db.on('error', function(err){
        console.log('Oops:', err);
    });
